## üåü Project Overview

This is a dynamic, responsive To-Do List application created to track and manage class work and tasks for the **SM High Tech Industrial Engineering Care (SMIEC) Web Development** course. It provides students and the instructor with a simple interface to record, update, and review daily progress.

### Core Objectives

* **Record Class Data:** Track essential student and class information (Name, Polytechnic, Class No., Date, Tools Used, Work Details).
* **Data Persistence:** Utilize **Local Storage** to save all entries directly in the user's browser, ensuring data remains intact even after a page refresh.
* **User Experience:** Implement responsive design and a theme-switching feature (Dark/Light Mode).
